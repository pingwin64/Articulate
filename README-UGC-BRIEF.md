# Articulate - AI UGC Creative Brief

## What is Articulate?

Articulate is a minimalist reading app that displays **one word at a time**. Users tap or let the app auto-advance through curated texts (stories, articles, speeches, philosophy, poetry) while optionally reading aloud. It's designed to build focus, improve reading fluency, and create a daily mindfulness-through-reading habit.

**Core tagline:** *"One word. Nothing else. Pure focus."*
