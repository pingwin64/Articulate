    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Articulate is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>Local Data</h2>
    <p>Articulate stores your reading preferences, statistics, progress, and settings locally on your device using secure on-device storage (MMKV). This includes your reading level, display preferences, streak data, daily goals, and reading history.</p>
    <p>Articulate does not require an account or login. No user-identifying information is collected.</p>

    <h2>Cloud Processing</h2>
    <p>Certain features send data to cloud services for processing. This data is processed in real-time and is not stored on any server:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Text extraction (OCR, PDF parsing): When you scan text from an image or import a PDF, the image or file data is sent to Supabase-hosted edge functions for processing via OpenAI's API. The extracted text is returned to your device and not retained server-side.</li>
      <li>Quiz generation: When you take a comprehension quiz, the reading text is sent to Supabase-hosted edge functions, which use OpenAI as a third-party AI provider to generate quiz questions. The questions are returned to your device and not stored.</li>
      <li>Audio transcription: When you use the pronunciation practice feature, your recorded audio is sent to OpenAI's Whisper API for transcription. The audio is processed and discarded immediately.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Transmitted data is processed and discarded — it is not stored, logged, or used for model training.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Articulate uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Provides AI-powered text extraction, quiz generation, and audio transcription. Data sent to OpenAI is subject to OpenAI's API data usage policies.</li>
      <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Manages subscription and purchase processing. RevenueCat receives an anonymous app user ID and purchase transaction data from Apple. RevenueCat does not receive your name, email, or other personal information from Articulate.</li>
      <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> Handles all payment processing. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
    <p>Articulate offers optional in-app purchases and subscriptions processed through Apple's App Store. Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information.</p>
    <p>Subscription management, including cancellation and refunds, is handled through your App Store account settings.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Articulate does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app is designed to be safe for users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>If you are in the European Economic Area, you have the right to access, rectify, and erase your personal data. Since all persistent data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it at all times.</p>
    <p>You can delete all app data by using the "Reset All Data" option in Settings, or by uninstalling Articulate. No personal data is stored on external servers.</p>

    <h2>California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
    <p>If you are a California resident, please note that we do not sell, share, or disclose your personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app and on this page with an updated revision date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@articulate.app">support@articulate.app</a>.</p>
