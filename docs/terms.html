    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using Articulate ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>Service Description</h2>
    <p>Articulate is a reading practice application that displays text one word at a time, designed to improve reading focus, fluency, and comprehension. The App may include free and premium features.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
    <p>Articulate offers optional auto-renewing subscriptions and one-time purchases to unlock premium features. Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</p>
    <p>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price.</p>
    <p>You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your App Store account settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.</p>

    <h2>Free Trial</h2>
    <p>Articulate may offer a free trial period for premium features. If you do not cancel before the trial ends, your subscription will begin and you will be charged the applicable subscription fee.</p>

    <h2>User Content</h2>
    <p>You may paste or import text into the App for personal reading practice. You are solely responsible for ensuring you have the right to use any content you add to the App. All user-added content is stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App, including its design, code, and built-in reading content, is the intellectual property of the developer. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse-engineer any part of the App.</p>
    <p>Built-in reading passages are sourced from works in the public domain. Original short texts included in the App are copyright of the developer.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Certain features use cloud processing (quiz generation, text extraction) powered by third-party services. Your use of these features is subject to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free or uninterrupted.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

    <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. We will update the revision date at the top of this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms of Service, please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@ordco.net">admin@ordco.net</a>.</p>
