## Description — 4,000 char max
```
Read one word at a time. Understand everything.

Articulate transforms how you read. Instead of scanning pages, you focus on a single word displayed at your own pace. The result: faster reading, deeper comprehension, and vocabulary that actually sticks.

Unlike other speed readers, Articulate is a complete reading and learning app with built-in quizzes, pronunciation practice, and spaced-repetition flashcards.

HOW IT WORKS

Open a text, tap play, and read one word at a time. Adjust the speed from a gentle 100 WPM to a blazing 600+ WPM. When you finish, take an AI-generated comprehension quiz to test what you retained. Save unfamiliar words to your word bank and review them with flashcards.

CURATED LIBRARY

30+ handpicked texts spanning classic literature, famous speeches, poetry, philosophy, and more. New content added regularly. Every text is chosen to reward close reading.

CUSTOM TEXT IMPORT

Paste any text, scan a page with your camera, or import a PDF. Read anything the way it was meant to be read: one word at a time, with full focus.

AI COMPREHENSION QUIZZES

After finishing a text, take a quiz generated by AI to test your understanding. Track your scores over time and watch your comprehension improve.

PRONUNCIATION PRACTICE

Tap any word to hear it spoken aloud. Then practice saying it yourself and get instant AI feedback on your pronunciation. A feature no other reading app offers.

WORD BANK & FLASHCARDS

Save words you want to remember. Review them with flashcards using spaced repetition so they move from short-term to long-term memory.
