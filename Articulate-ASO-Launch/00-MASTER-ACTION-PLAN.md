# Articulate — ASO Master Action Plan

**Generated:** February 13, 2026
**Platform:** Apple App Store (iOS)
**Category:** Education (primary) + Reference (secondary)
**Launch Target:** Submit Feb 26 → Live by March 2

---

## Key Findings at a Glance

**Articulate occupies genuine white space.** No competitor combines RSVP reading + vocabulary from context + pronunciation drills + comprehension quizzes + spaced repetition + accessibility (OpenDyslexic). This is your moat.

**Top competitors analyzed (real data):**
| App | Rating | Reviews | Threat |
|-----|--------|---------|--------|
| Elevate | 4.7 | ~250K | HIGH (scale, but mini-games not real reading) |
| WordUp | 4.77 | ~12K | MEDIUM (vocab focus, has pronunciation) |
| Blinkist | 4.8 | ~106K | MEDIUM (massive brand, different value prop) |
| Magoosh | 4.72 | ~6.9K | LOW (test-prep only, broken features) |
| Vocabulary.com | 4.31 | ~4.8K | LOW (not updated since 2021) |
| Spreeder | 4.64 | ~310 | MEDIUM (closest RSVP competitor) |

**5 major competitive gaps identified:** reading + vocab combined, pronunciation drills tied to reading, RSVP with learning system, dyslexia/accessibility support, custom text upload in learning context.

## DECIDED: App Title & Subtitle

| Field | Value | Chars |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Title** | `Articulate: Read Word by Word` | 29/30 |
| **Subtitle** | `Vocabulary Builder & Reader` | 27/30 |

**Strategy:** Creative title (hook/differentiation) + keyword-rich subtitle (traffic/discovery). The title makes people stop scrolling. The subtitle ranks for "vocabulary builder" (#1 keyword) and "reader."

### Subtitle A/B Test Plan (Post-Launch)
Once the app hits **50+ reviews**, run a Product Page Optimization test:
- **Control:** `Vocabulary Builder & Reader` (keyword-driven)
- **Variant:** `Learn Vocabulary by Reading` (creative — flows with title as a sentence)
- Keep whichever has the higher tap-through rate
- The creative version tells a story: *"Read word by word — learn vocabulary by reading"*
