## Version Update Strategy

### Update Cadence
- **First month:** weekly or bi-weekly (bug fixes, quick wins)
- **Months 2-3:** bi-weekly (feature additions, polish)
- **Months 4+:** monthly (steady improvements, content additions)

### Every Version Update Should Include
1. Bug fixes (from review feedback and crash reports)
2. At least one user-requested improvement
3. Updated "What's New" text (users read this)
4. Consider updating: keywords, promotional text, description
5. New screenshots ONLY if UI changed significantly

### What's New Best Practices
- Lead with the most exciting change
- Use plain language, not technical jargon
- Keep it short (3-5 bullet points)
- Example:
  ```
  - Pronunciation practice: AI feedback on your spoken words
  - 5 new curated texts (poetry and philosophy)
  - Fixed crash when switching themes during reading
  - Improved reading speed slider responsiveness
  ```

## A/B Testing Schedule

### When to Start
- After 500+ daily impressions (need volume for statistical significance)
- After 2-4 weeks live (baseline data established)

### What to Test (In Priority Order)

**Test 1: First Screenshot (Week 4-8)**
- Control: current first screenshot (RSVP reading)
- Variant: different angle (e.g., "Read 2x Faster" outcome-focused)
- Metric: Conversion rate (impressions to installs)
- Duration: 4 weeks minimum or until statistically significant

**Test 2: Icon (Week 8-12)**
- Control: current icon
- Variant: alternative design
- Metric: Conversion rate
- Duration: 4 weeks

**Test 3: Screenshot Order (Week 12-16)**
- Control: current order (RSVP > speed > library > quiz > flashcards > import)
- Variant: reordered (library first, or quiz first)
- Metric: Conversion rate

**Test 4: Title (Requires Version Update, Month 3-4)**
- Control: `Articulate: One Word Reader`
- Variant: `Articulate - Speed Reader` or `Articulate: Focus Reader`
- Metric: Keyword rankings + conversion rate
- Run for 4 weeks, then switch if variant wins

### A/B Test Rules
- Only run ONE test at a time (isolate variables)
- Run for minimum 4 weeks or 1,000 impressions per variant
- Do not change anything else while a test is running
- Document results in a simple log

## When Things Go Wrong

### Downloads Suddenly Drop
1. Check if a competitor launched or updated
2. Check if your keywords dropped in rankings
3. Check if Apple changed search algorithms (usually announced)
4. Check if your app has new crashes (stability affects rankings)
5. Check if a negative review went viral

### Rating Drops Below 4.0
1. Respond to every negative review
2. Fix the most common complaint
3. Ship a quality update
4. Prompt happy users for reviews (in-app, via StoreReview API)
5. Update "What's New" to show you listen to feedback

### Conversion Rate Drops
1. Check if screenshots are still compelling
2. Check if a competitor updated their listing (stealing attention)
3. A/B test new screenshots or icon
4. Review your description: is it still relevant?
5. Check if your first 3 screenshots tell a clear story

## The Compound Effect

ASO is not a one-time task. Small, consistent improvements compound:

- Week 1: Get the basics right (metadata, screenshots, keywords)
- Month 1: Fix bugs, respond to reviews, establish baseline metrics
- Month 3: First keyword optimization based on real data
- Month 6: Multiple A/B tests completed, screenshots refined, content expanded
- Month 12: App ranking is significantly better than at launch

The apps that win in App Store search are the ones that consistently optimize, not the ones that had the best launch. Show up every week.
