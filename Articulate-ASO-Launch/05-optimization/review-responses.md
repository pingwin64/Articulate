## Tone Guide

1. **Always thank the reviewer** -- even for 1-star reviews
2. **Use their name** if visible (App Store often shows first name)
3. **Be specific** -- reference what they mentioned, not generic praise
4. **Offer a path forward** -- support email, upcoming fix, workaround
5. **Stay short** -- 3-5 sentences is ideal. Nobody reads paragraphs in review responses.
6. **Never be defensive** -- acknowledge the issue, do not explain it away
7. **Never mention competitors by name** in responses
8. **Never promise specific dates** for features unless you are certain
9. **Never argue** -- if the review is unfair, stay gracious. Other users read your response.
10. **Sign consistently** -- "- The Articulate Team" (even if you are solo, "team" sounds professional)

Sorry about this experience. [Crashing/bug] is not acceptable and we want to fix it right away.

Could you send us details at admin@ordco.net? Your device model and iOS version would help us reproduce the issue. We will prioritize a fix in our next update.

Thank you for reporting this.

- The Articulate Team
```

### 2B: Frustrated With Limitations

We hear you -- the [limit they mentioned] can be frustrating. We offer [specific free tier detail] to give you a real taste of the app, with premium unlocking everything.

That said, your feedback matters. If there is a specific improvement that would change your experience, let us know at admin@ordco.net.

- The Articulate Team
```

Sorry the app was not intuitive. That is on us -- we want Articulate to be easy for everyone.

Here is a quick start: tap a category on the home screen, pick a text, then tap to start reading. Words appear one at a time. After finishing, try the quiz.

If you give it another shot and still feel lost, email us at admin@ordco.net and we will help you get set up.

- The Articulate Team
```

---

## 1-Star Reviews

### 1A: App Crashed or Did Not Work
```
We are really sorry about this. A crash or broken experience is the last thing we want.

Please email us at admin@ordco.net with your device model and iOS version, and we will investigate immediately. We want to make this right.

- The Articulate Team
```

### 1B: Angry About Subscription/Pricing
```
Thank you for the feedback on pricing. We understand not everyone wants a subscription.

Articulate offers a free tier with RSVP reading, a curated library, daily quizzes, and definition lookups at no cost. Premium is optional for users who want the full experience.

We appreciate you trying the app.

- The Articulate Team
```

### 1C: Vague Negative ("This app sucks")
```
Sorry to hear that. We would genuinely like to understand what went wrong so we can improve.

If you are willing to share specifics at admin@ordco.net, we will take your feedback seriously. Every review helps us build a better app.

- The Articulate Team
```

## Issue-Specific Templates

### Subscription/Payment Issues
```
Sorry you are having trouble with your subscription. Here are some things to try:

1. Go to Settings > tap your name > Subscriptions to verify your subscription status
2. In Articulate, try "Restore Purchases" (on the upgrade screen or in Settings)
3. Restart the app

If that does not resolve it, email us at admin@ordco.net and we will sort it out. We want to make sure you get what you paid for.

- The Articulate Team
```

### "Not a Speed Reading App"
```
Fair point! Articulate is more of a "focused reading and learning" app than a traditional speed reader. The one-word-at-a-time approach is designed for comprehension and vocabulary building, not just raw speed.

That said, you can push the WPM up to 600+ if speed is your goal. We hope you will give it another try!

- The Articulate Team
```

### Feature Request
```
Great idea! [Feature they requested] is something we have been thinking about too. We cannot promise a timeline, but user requests directly influence our roadmap.

Thanks for taking the time to share this.

- The Articulate Team
```

### "Too Many Paywalls"
```
Thanks for the feedback. We hear you on this and want to get the balance right.

The free tier includes one-word reading, curated texts in 3 categories, daily quizzes, and definition lookups -- all at no cost. Premium is for users who want everything unlocked.

We are always refining the experience based on feedback like yours.

- The Articulate Team
```

### Pronunciation Not Working
```
Sorry the pronunciation feature did not work properly. This feature requires an internet connection and microphone access.

Could you check:
1. Microphone permission is enabled for Articulate (Settings > Articulate > Microphone)
2. You have an internet connection when using it

If it still does not work, email us at admin@ordco.net with what happened and we will investigate.

- The Articulate Team
```

### Quiz Complaints (Too Easy/Hard/Wrong)
```
Thanks for the feedback on the quizzes! They are generated by AI based on the text you read, so they can occasionally miss the mark.

We are continuously improving the quiz quality. If you have a specific example of a bad question, send it to admin@ordco.net and we will use it to make the system smarter.

- The Articulate Team
```

### OpenDyslexic/Accessibility Feedback
```
Thank you for the feedback on our accessibility features. Making reading accessible is important to us.

[If positive:] We are glad OpenDyslexic and our focus mode are helping. If you have ideas for how we can do even better, we would love to hear them.

[If negative:] We want to improve this. Could you share specifics at admin@ordco.net? What would make the reading experience better for you?

- The Articulate Team
```

### "Not Enough Texts/Content"
```
Totally fair feedback -- we launched with 30+ texts and are adding more with every update. We want the library to keep growing.

In the meantime, you can paste any text you want into the app (Custom Text feature) to read anything in RSVP mode.

What kind of content would you like to see more of? Let us know at admin@ordco.net.

- The Articulate Team
```

### Request to Read Specific Format (ePub, Web Articles, etc.)
```
Great suggestion! Supporting [format they mentioned] is something we are exploring. For now, you can paste text directly into the app to read it one word at a time.

We will keep your feedback in mind as we plan future updates. Thank you!

- The Articulate Team
```

## Things to NEVER Say in a Review Response

- "That is not a bug, it is a feature"
- "You are using it wrong"
- "Other users do not have this problem"
- "We are a small team" (sounds like an excuse)
- "Just email us" without first acknowledging their issue
- Naming competitors ("unlike Outread..." or "better than Spreeder...")
- Promising specific release dates ("fixed in next week's update")
- Blaming Apple, iOS, or the user's device
- Anything sarcastic or passive-aggressive

---

## Review Response Workflow

1. **Morning check (9 AM):** Open App Store Connect > Ratings and Reviews
2. **Read all new reviews**
3. **Categorize each:** positive, constructive, bug report, complaint, spam
4. **Respond using templates above** -- personalize each one
5. **Log patterns:** if 3+ people mention the same issue, flag it for fixing
6. **Evening check (5 PM):** Catch any reviews that came in during the day
7. **Track in a simple spreadsheet:**
   - Date | Rating | Summary | Response Sent | Follow-up Needed

---

## Asking for Reviews (In-App)

After a user completes a positive action (finishing a text, hitting a streak milestone, unlocking an achievement), prompt for a review using `expo-store-review`:

```
StoreReview.requestReview()
```

Rules:
- Only ask once (tracked via `hasRequestedReview` in store)
- Only ask after the user has had a genuinely positive experience
- Never ask immediately after a paywall dismissal
- Never ask after a bug or error
- Apple controls when the dialog actually appears (may suppress it)
