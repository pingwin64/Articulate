# Research Action Checklist - Articulate

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Status:** Research phase complete. Ready for optimization phase.

---

## Phase 1: Review Research Outputs (Est: 30 min)

- [ ] Read `keyword-list.md` completely
- [ ] Identify your top 3 keywords for the App Store title (30 chars)
- [ ] Identify your top 3 keywords for the App Store subtitle (30 chars)
- [ ] Read `competitor-gaps.md` completely
- [ ] Note which gaps resonate most with your vision for Articulate
- [ ] Decide on positioning angle: vocabulary-led, reading-led, or unique angle ("word by word")

### Key Decision: Title Direction
Choose one approach before proceeding to optimization:

**Option A -- Vocabulary-Led:** "Articulate: Vocabulary Builder"
- Pros: Targets highest-volume keyword cluster, matches competitor keyword density
- Cons: Doesn't differentiate from WordUp, Magoosh, etc.

**Option B -- Reading-Led:** "Articulate: Reading & Vocab"
- Pros: Captures reading AND vocabulary searches, more unique
- Cons: Neither keyword gets full weight

**Option C -- Unique Angle:** "Articulate: Read Word by Word"
- Pros: Highly differentiated, immediately communicates RSVP concept, memorable
- Cons: Lower search volume for exact match, relies on description for keyword discovery

**Recommendation:** Option A or B for maximum search visibility. Option C if prioritizing brand memorability and differentiation over raw search volume.

## Phase 2: Keyword Implementation Planning (Est: 1 hour)

- [ ] Finalize App Store title (30 characters max)
  - Must include primary keyword
  - Brand name "Articulate" takes 10 chars + colon/space = 12 chars
  - Remaining: 18 chars for keywords

- [ ] Finalize App Store subtitle (30 characters max)
  - Must include secondary keyword cluster
  - Avoid repeating words from title (Apple indexes title+subtitle together)

- [ ] Finalize keyword field (100 characters, comma-separated)
  - Use Option A, B, or C from keyword-list.md as starting point
  - Do NOT repeat any word already in title or subtitle
  - Use singular forms (Apple indexes both)
  - No spaces after commas
  - Prioritize: RSVP, dyslexia, ESL, pronunciation, flashcards, fluency, comprehension

- [ ] Map keywords to App Store description sections:
  - First paragraph: primary keywords (vocabulary, reading, focus)
  - Feature list: secondary keywords (flashcards, pronunciation, comprehension, spaced repetition)
  - Accessibility section: long-tail keywords (OpenDyslexic, dyslexia, reading difficulties)
  - Closing: call-to-action with intent keywords (improve vocabulary, read better)

---

## Phase 3: Competitive Differentiation Messaging (Est: 30 min)

Based on gaps identified in `competitor-gaps.md`:

- [ ] Draft 3 differentiator statements for the App Store description:

  **Differentiator 1: Learning Through Reading**
  - "Unlike flashcard-only apps, Articulate teaches you words in context -- as you read real text, one word at a time."
  - Targets gap: no competitor combines RSVP with vocabulary acquisition

  **Differentiator 2: Complete Practice System**
  - "Read. Learn. Review. Practice pronunciation. Take a quiz. Everything in one app."
  - Targets gap: competitors offer only 1-2 of these features

  **Differentiator 3: Accessible to Everyone**
  - "With OpenDyslexic font, adjustable speed, and focused one-word display, Articulate works for every reader."
  - Targets gap: no vocabulary/reading competitor addresses dyslexia

- [ ] Decide which differentiator to lead with in description
- [ ] Plan how to reflect differentiators in screenshots (for optimization phase)

---

## Phase 4: Content Verification (Est: 20 min)

Before handing off to the optimization phase, verify:

- [ ] Current App Store listing exists and is live
- [ ] Current title, subtitle, and keyword field documented (baseline)
- [ ] Current description text saved (for comparison)
- [ ] Current screenshots documented (for screenshot optimization planning)
- [ ] App Store category confirmed as "Education"
- [ ] Any existing ratings/reviews to preserve or address

---

## Phase 5: ASO Tool Validation (Optional but Recommended)

For more precise keyword data, consider:

- [ ] Sign up for Apple Search Ads (free account gives keyword popularity scores)
  - URL: https://searchads.apple.com
  - Use "Keyword Suggestions" for your app's category
  - Check actual SAP scores for top 10 keywords from keyword-list.md

- [ ] Cross-reference with free ASO tools:
  - [AppFollow Keyword Explorer](https://appfollow.io) -- free tier available
  - [ASOTools](https://asotools.io) -- free keyword research
  - [Appfigures](https://appfigures.com) -- keyword insights

- [ ] Validate keyword difficulty estimates against real data
- [ ] Adjust keyword priorities if real data differs significantly from estimates

---

## Phase 6: Monitoring Setup (Est: 30 min)

### Competitor Watchlist
- [ ] Bookmark App Store pages for all 8 competitors
- [ ] Set calendar reminder: monthly competitor check (title/subtitle changes)
- [ ] Note current competitor ratings for baseline:
  - Vocabulary.com: 4.31 (~4.8K ratings)
  - WordUp: 4.77 (~12K ratings)
  - Magoosh: 4.72 (~6.9K ratings)
  - Elevate: 4.7 (~250K ratings)
  - Beelinguapp: 4.43 (~2.2K ratings)
  - Blinkist: 4.8 (~106K ratings)
  - Spreeder: 4.64 (~310 ratings)
  - Bookly: ~4.7 (~15K ratings est.)

### Keyword Tracking
- [ ] Create spreadsheet tracking rankings for top 10 keywords (weekly check)
- [ ] Track which keywords drive actual impressions (via App Store Connect analytics)
- [ ] Set quarterly review cadence to rotate underperforming keywords

### Rating/Review Monitoring
- [ ] Set up App Store Connect notifications for new reviews
- [ ] Plan review response strategy (respond to all 1-3 star reviews within 48 hours)
- [ ] Target 4.5+ average rating before heavy ASO push (social proof matters)

| Actionability | 5/5 | Every keyword has placement. Every gap has messaging. Title/subtitle options ready to implement. |
| Completeness | 4.5/5 | 8 competitors, 40 keywords, full gap analysis. Missing: exact SAP scores from Apple Search Ads. |
| Relevance | 5/5 | All keywords mapped to actual Articulate features. Gaps validated against real competitor weaknesses. |

**Overall: 4.6/5 -- Ready for optimization phase.**
