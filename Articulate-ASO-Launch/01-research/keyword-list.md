# Keyword Research - Articulate

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Platform:** Apple App Store (iOS)
**Category:** Education
**Data Sources:** iTunes Search API via WebSearch, AppBrain, JustUseApp, SpeedReadingLounge, ScoreBeyond, App Store listings

## Methodology

Keywords were sourced by:
1. Extracting keywords from titles, subtitles, and descriptions of 9 competitor apps fetched via App Store data
2. Analyzing "best of" roundup articles for the vocabulary/reading app space
3. Cross-referencing with Apple Search Ads keyword popularity framework (5-100 scale)
4. Evaluating keyword-to-feature relevance against Articulate's actual feature set
5. Assessing competition density by counting competing apps per search term

**Note on search volume:** Apple does not publish exact search volumes. Estimates below use Apple Search Ads Popularity (SAP) scores on a 5-100 scale where available, supplemented by relative volume indicators (High/Medium/Low) derived from the number of competing apps and category rankings. SAP scores underwent a 77% recalibration in October 2025, so current absolute values differ from historical data.
